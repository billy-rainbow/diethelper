"""
acting as a python programmer, write a python script that: 1) prompts the user for the name of a plain text input file if one is not given on the command line; 2) read the file line at a time; 3) makes a list out of each line by breaking it into words using commas, spaces, tabs, and parentheses as delimiters; 4) places all entries from the list that include only numbers except for a single terminating character 'g' in a new list identified as weights after deleting the terminal 'g character; 5) places all entries from the first list that include only numbers except for a single terminating character 'c' in a new list identified as calories after deleting the terminal 'c' character; 6) deletes all of the second, weights list members that can't be converted to numbers from the list and prints the list on one line; 7) sums the second, weights list; 8) prints the sum after the label: "Weights: "; 9) deletes all of the third, calories list members that can't be converted to numbers from the list prints the list on one line; 10) sums the third, calories list; 11) prints the sum after the label: "Calories: "
