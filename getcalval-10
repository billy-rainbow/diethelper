"""
Acting as a python programmer, write a script to split a text file into a list of  words using spaces, commas, and close parentheses for delimiters. Check the command line to see if a valid filename of an existing file has been supplied. If no filename has been specified, the script should prompt for the name of the text file.   Delete all words from the list that include characters that are not numbers or the lower case character 'c'.  Print the list on one line. Delete all non-numeric characters from each entry.  Delete all entries that are not valid numeric strings.  Add them all together, and print the sum prefixed with the string "Total calories: "
