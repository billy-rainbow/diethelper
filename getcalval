"""
Acting as a python programmer, write a python script that:
1) imports the os and sys modules
2) prompts the user for the name of a plain text input file if one is not given on the command line;
3) reads the file line at a time;
4) makes a list out of each line by spliting it into words using commas, spaces, tabs, and parentheses as delimiters;
5) for each element of the list, if ( the length of the element is greater than 1 and its last character is a 'g' ), then delete the 'g', delete all spaces and tabs, and only if the member can be converted to a number, add it to a list identified as weights;
6) for each element of the list, if (the length of the element is greater than 1 and its last character is a 'c' ), then delete the 'c', delete all spaces and tabs, and only if the member can be converted to a number, add it to a list identified as calories;
7) prints the weights list on one line;
8) sums the weights list and prints the sum after the label: "Weights: ";
9) prints the calories list on one line;
10) sums the calories list and prints the sum after the label: "Calories: ";
