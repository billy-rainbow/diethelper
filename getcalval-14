"""
acting as a python programmer, write a python script that: 1) prompts the user for the name of a plain text input file if one is not given on the command line; 2) read the file line at a time; 3) makes a list out of each line by breaking it into words using commas, spaces, tabs, and parentheses as delimiters; 4) places all entries from the list that are entirely numeric with the exception of a single character 'g' terminating them in a new list identified as weights after deleting the terminal 'g character; 5) places all entries from the first list that are entirely numeric with the exception of a single character 'c' terminating them in a new list identified as calories after deleting the terminal 'c' character; 6) prints the second, weights list on one line; 7) sums the second, weights list; 8) prints the sum after the label: "Weights: "; 9) prints the third, calories list on one line; 10) sums the third, calories list; 11) prints the sum after the label: "Calories: "
