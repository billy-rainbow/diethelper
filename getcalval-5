acting as a python programmer, write a script to split a text file into a list of  words. use spaces, commas, and close parentheses for delimiters. each word must have numbers and end with a lower case character 'c'.  delete from the list any words that include characters other than numbers and the lower case character 'c'.  print the list on one line delimited by spaces. delete the lower case character 'c' from each entry, add them all together, and print the sum prefixed with the string "Total calories: " the script should prompt for the name of the text file if it's not supplied as an argument on the command line.
