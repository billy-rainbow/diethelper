"""
Acting as a python programmer, write a script that imports the os and sys modules, then checks the command line to see if a valid filename of an existing text file has been supplied. If no filename has been specified, the script should prompt for the name of the file.  Reference all uses of "argv" as "sys.argv".  Next, using spaces, commas, and close parentheses for delimiters, split the entire file into a single list of  words. Delete all members of the list that do not end with a lower case character 'c', then delete the 'c' from each remaining member.  Delete all non-numeric members of the list.  Delete all null members of the list. Print the list on one line, prefaced with the label, "Calorie values: ". Add them all together, and print the sum prefixed with the string "Total calories: "
